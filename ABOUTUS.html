  <h2 class="whoarewe"> Who are we</h2>
  <p class="story">The story about two regular girls from Sweden, 
  who been dreaming about having our own fashion e-commerce. 
  It all started from selling clothes on eBay, 
  and from there we been daydreaming about all things we want to design and have our own clothing line. 
  The idea behind YRISSTUIODS is that we also saw a big gap in the Swedish online market, 
  from pieces we were lacking in our closet. 
  So we decided to create a timeless collection with wide range of appeal clothing for women that will attract,
  and adapt weather she is curvy or petite. All the pieces will be design by us at our studio in Stockholm. </p>
  <h3 class="whythename">Why the name YRIS</h3>
  <p class="idea">
The idea behind YRISSTUDIOS name, came from one good friend of mine called YRIS. 
The meaning of the name means self-express and having ambitious in life. 
YRIS means “self-express” which define an excursion into self-expression through our clothes 
and embodies of what our brand will be about.
